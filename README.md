# 💡 LightComm - Light-Based Communication App

A fascinating web application that enables phones to communicate through light patterns! Send messages by flashing your screen and receive them by pointing your camera at the flashing screen.

## 🌟 Features

### 📱 Sender Mode
- **Text Input**: Enter messages up to 100 characters
- **Encoding Options**: 
  - Binary encoding (fast transmission)
  - Morse code (classic communication)
- **Adjustable Flash Speed**: Control transmission speed (100-1000ms)
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time progress bar and bit display
- **Screen Flashing**: Uses screen brightness modulation for transmission

### 📷 Receiver Mode
- **Camera Detection**: Uses device camera to detect light patterns
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live brightness monitoring and signal detection
- **Automatic Decoding**: Converts received light patterns back to text
- **Visual Indicators**: Brightness bars, signal status, and received bit count
- **Raw Data View**: See the actual bits being received

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings
- **Brightness Threshold**: Adjust sensitivity for light detection
- **Detection Region**: Control the area of the camera used for detection
- **Configurable Parameters**: Fine-tune for different lighting conditions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with camera access support
- Two devices for testing (sender and receiver)
- Decent lighting conditions

### Setup
1. **Clone or Download** this repository
2. **Serve the files** using a local web server:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
4. **Allow camera access** when prompted (required for receiver mode)

### Quick Test
1. Open the app on two devices
2. On **Device 1**: Switch to Sender mode, type "Hello World", click "Start Transmission"
3. On **Device 2**: Switch to Receiver mode, point camera at Device 1's screen, click "Start Receiving"
4. Watch the magic happen! 🎉

## 🔧 How It Works

### Signal Encoding
- **Binary Mode**: Converts text to 8-bit ASCII binary with start/end markers
- **Morse Mode**: Converts text to Morse code patterns
- **Light Patterns**: `1` = bright flash, `0` = dark/no flash

### Light Detection
- **Camera Analysis**: Captures video frames and analyzes brightness
- **Region Detection**: Focuses on center area of camera view
- **Threshold Detection**: Distinguishes between light and dark states
- **Edge Detection**: Identifies transitions between states

### Signal Processing
- **Start/End Markers**: `1010` and `0101` mark message boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Validates decoded text for printable characters
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows detection progress and status

## 📱 Usage Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Distance**: Keep devices 1-3 feet apart
2. **Alignment**: Point receiver camera directly at sender screen
3. **Lighting**: Use in moderate lighting (not too bright/dark)
4. **Stability**: Keep both devices steady during transmission
5. **Speed**: Start with slower speeds (500-700ms) for better accuracy

### Troubleshooting:
- **No signal detected**: Adjust brightness threshold in settings
- **Garbled messages**: Reduce flash speed or improve alignment
- **Camera issues**: Ensure browser has camera permissions
- **Poor detection**: Try different detection region size

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Key Classes and Methods
- `LightComm`: Main application class
- `encodeMessage()`: Text to light pattern encoding
- `startTransmission()`: Screen flashing control
- `startBrightnessAnalysis()`: Camera-based detection
- `tryDecodeMessage()`: Pattern to text decoding

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Practical Applications
- **Silent Communication**: Communicate without sound
- **Emergency Messaging**: When other communication fails
- **Educational Demo**: Demonstrate digital communication principles
- **Fun Experiments**: Impress friends with "magic" messaging
- **Security Research**: Explore covert communication channels

### Limitations
- **Speed**: Much slower than traditional messaging
- **Range**: Limited to visual line-of-sight
- **Environment**: Sensitive to lighting conditions
- **Accuracy**: May have errors in poor conditions

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
- **Error Correction**: Add checksums and error correction codes
- **Compression**: Implement text compression for longer messages
- **Color Coding**: Use RGB colors for higher data density
- **Frequency Modulation**: Variable flash frequencies for more data
- **Camera Flash**: Use camera LED for brighter signals
- **File Transfer**: Support for sending small files/images
